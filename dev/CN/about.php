Welcome to Cyber Nations, a nation simulation game. Create 
a nation 
anywhere in the world and decide how you will rule your people by choosing 
a government type, a national religion, ethnicity, tax rate, currency 
type, and more in this new geo-political, nation, and government simulator. Build your empire by purchasing infrastructure to 
support your citizens, land to expand your borders, technology to increase your 
		nation's effectiveness, and national improvements to build your nation 
		according to your choosing. </td>

		<p align="justify">Cyber Nations is an Internet web based game about 
		simulating nation building and management and will require you to 
		exercise your management skills on a day to day basis. You can play 
		Cyber Nations with most modern web browsers that have JavaScript 
		enabled. Cyber Nations runs 24/7 (except when we are performing 
		maintenance and upgrades) so even while you are not online your nation 
		will still be active allowing other players to interact with you through 
		trade offers, foreign aid offers, war declarations, private messages, 
		and much more. Cyber Nations has never been reset since it's inception 
		on 01/06/06 and no resets are planned in the future. We take extreme 
		care to provide complete backups of our game databases and files to 
		ensure your uninterrupted gaming experience. </td>

of a benevolent government or rule them with an iron fist as a malevolent 
dictator. Become a war monger and participate in destroying other nations or 
		grow peacefully as a diplomat among the other nations of the world. Grow your nation in size and strength to become all powerful or run 
your nation into the ground through mismanagement. It’s all up to you. </span>

<p align="justify"><span class="spnMessageText"><b>Playing the Game </b>- Once 
you've registered a user ID and created your nation there are many things you 
can do. You can purchase infrastructure, land, build your military forces, or 
begin saving your money to purchase that first level of technology; which ever 
direction you want to go. I could spend a lot of time discussing everything here but you probably just 
want to get on with the game. Here's a few tips to get you started:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><span class="spnMessageText">Probably the most common 
	activity that you will perform in Cyber Nations is collecting taxes and 
	paying bills. You can collect a percentage of your citizens income base on 
	your government's tax rate each day. The money that you collect can be used 
	for nation purchases or to send to others via the foreign aid system. You 
	can collect your taxes once everyday or save up for a couple of days between 
	tax collections to gain an added bonus in interest. Beware however, the same rule 
	applies to your nation's bills (charged for on infrastructure, soldiers, 
	tanks, etc...) so if you don't pay your taxes daily you might end up paying 
	interest on your unpaid bills.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/jpgtaxes.jpg" width="500" height="100"></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><span class="spnMessageText">Keep an eye on the Nation 
	Messages that appear at the top of your nation information page. These messages are 
	important and will guide you in the right direction of successfully managing 
	your nation. </span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><span class="spnMessageText">Keep an eye on the 
	happiness of your population. Nothing can bring an economy and progress down more than 
	unhappy citizens.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/about.2.gif"></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Keep a close eye on your Government 
	Financial information. Your financial situation determines what you can buy and 
	therefore how quickly your nation grows.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<span class="spnMessageText" id="msg"><img border="0" src="images/about.3.gif"></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><span class="spnMessageText">Even if you desire not to wage 
	wars and select to be a peaceful nation
	<img border="0" src="http://cybernations.net/images/peace.gif" width="19" height="19"> it is still important to 
	invest in your military. Soldiers act both as military and as a police force in Cyber 
	Nations so you'll want to have some soldiers defending your nation at all 
	times in order to keep your population happy. (Just make sure your forces 
	are not too powerful as they might make your citizens uncomfortable.)</span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify"><span class="spnMessageText">Seek trading partners early 
	on. There are many resources available in the Cyber Nations world, each with 
	their own unique benefits. Choose your resources carefully:</span></p></li>
