If you do not agree to these donation offer conditions DO NOT donate. If a player should voluntarily leave the game, if a player's nation is deleted by the player him/her self or banned by administration for ANY REASON, (cheating, violating TOS, violating official forum guidelines, 20 days inactivity, unstated reasons, etc...) or if the game is ever shut down or reset NO REFUNDS and NO compensation will be provided to the player or to any re-created nation. Sending a payment that is reversed, denied, or does not clear after the donation bonus has been provided will result in nation deletion since donation bonuses cannot be reversed once applied towards a nation. The donation bonus is final once it has been applied to your nation. If the bonus is lost in war, foreign aid, or other in-game activities the donation bonus will not be reapplied. 

Cyber Nations is not a charity and it is not a non-profit organization. Donations are used to help support the site including hosting fees, software licensing, maintenance, administration, and upgrades for the game as well as other expenses. 

Multiple donations sent within the same calendar month and donations not containing nation and ruler information are not eligible for the nation bonuses stated above. Nations may receive the store purchase bonus and one donation bonus within the same calendar month, no other donation stacking is available. All donation bonuses will be rewarded to your nation within 24 hours after your order receipt is received and verified by an administrator.
