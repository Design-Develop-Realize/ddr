				<h1>Summary</h1>
			<p>Born in the <a href="http://china-journeys.com/Xi'an_Prefecture.php" target="_blank">Xian Prefecture of China</a>, Ayden was born to Jiangmei and Klaus Schuster in 1984. His mother being born during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)" target="_blank">the year of the dragon</a>, he and his younger brother inherited the powers of the Water and Fire dragons at the time they were born. These powers are mystic in nature, inherited from multiple generations of those born with varying powers related to the five elemental dragons: Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Metal. If a person has inherited these powers, they are manifest for the first time on their 12th birhtday.</p>
			<p>The first manifestation of Ayden's powers were during a heavy rain during which his mother exclaimed that the heavy rains would ruin the plants in her garden. Wishing her garden to live caused the rain to pass completely over their home and into a neighboring town. For the next several weeks, any weather pattern that would bring rain was averted to another local community. During a visit to from one of his chinese grandparents, it was Ayden's grandmother that explained that the power of the Water Dragon was causing this phenomena and helped Ayden to restore the natural weather pattern for that town. After this, he was sent to his grandparents and spent the next few years understanding both his powers and, by extension, himself.</p>

					<h1>Powers &amp; Abilities</h1>
					<p>In order to teach Ayden to understand his gift, he was subjected to extensive training in a family martial art that is a little-known branch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido" target="_blank">Aikido</a> for multiple years after his powers orginally manifested.</p>
					<p>Because of this training, he is a master of both his family art and Aikido. After mastering Aikido, he went on to master <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo" target="_blank">Judo</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi" target="_blank">Taichi</a> to further his understanding of martial arts and the potential for his gift.</p>
					<p>At present, he can change the weather patterns on a given continent with little effort and can move an amount of water equal to the size of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior" target="_blank">Lake Superior</a> at one time with moderate effort and convert that from one form to another within seconds.</p>
					<p>He can also take on a gaseous or aqueous form. When in these forms, he can move as fast as water in that form could move from one place to another; for instance, he has an infinite capacity for speed within a body of water (in aqueous form) or within fog (in gaseous form).</p>
