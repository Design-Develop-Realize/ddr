				<h1>Before Soul Society</h1>
			<p>The first of five children, he excelled in most schools subjects. Because of his intense focus in school, he made very few friends. The friends that he found believed him to be interesting, yet distant. On his 15th birthday, he was involved in a car accident following a birthday party thrown at a local mall.</p>
			<p>After his death, he followed his friends, attempting to protect them however he could. Not being able to rescue them from natural dangers as a spirit, he turned his efforts to protecting them from spiritual ones. One day, a Hollow attacked a friend of his. Throwing himself into the fray to save them, the Hollow fought him, attempting to absorb him.</p>
			<p>While struggling against this Hollow, a shinigami appeared, dispatching it. The Soul Reaper's name escapes his memory, but he remembers a distinct red sash and orange hair along with brown eyes and a nearly gentle smile. Telling Akari that he would send him to heaven, he placed the end of his sword hilt to Akari's head, sending him to Soul Society where he ended up in Rukongai: District 5.</p>

			<h1>Rukongai: District 5</h1>
			<p>After being there for a time, he started to develop both hunger and thirst. He started to ask the people around him what he should do and they pointed to people in what appeared to be black robes with white undergarments.</p>
			<p>Knowing little about these people, he continued living his daily life with the residents of Rukongai 5 until a shinigami noticed his reiatsu. He politely walked up to Akari and asked to speak to him for a moment, asking if he had thought about becoming a shinigami. Akari simply replied, "Maybe." The shinigami smiled and said, "We have an academy. You may want to think about joining. I'm sure you will do wonderful things for the world."</p>
			<p>Noting the shinigami and remembering the friends he left behind on earth, he joined the shinigami academy.</p>

					<h1>The Hungry Student</h1>
					<p>Devoting himself to his studies, he was at the top of his class. Finding an affinity to the spirit world around him, he easily understood the nature of spirit energy and the particles of which it is composed and used kidou with exceptional skill. He enjoyed this aspect of his education at the Academy very much.</p>
					<p>Not one to let any grade slip, he strove to excel in all of his subjects, practicing tirelessly until late hours perfecting his technique and timing. His mind thirsted for the intricacies of the spiritual world and so he pursued even more intensely any knowledge he could obtain about kidou and spiritual energy in general. Sneaking off into the night and cloaking his reiatsu, he would steal into the Great Libraries reading each book and absorbing the all the knowledge on any kind of kidou or manipulation of it he could find. His thirst for knowledge took him so far as to study certain forbidden techniques.</p>
					<p>One night, as he practiced these, one of the captains walked in on him.</p>
					<p>"Akari-kun, what are you doing?"</p>
					<p>No words were offered in response.</p>
					<p>"Akari-kun, I can understand your thirst for knowledge, but I must ask that you neither study nor use these techniques. They are against the Soul Society laws and by those laws you can be exiled for even their practice let alone their actual use. Do you understand?"</p>
					<p>"Yes, Mahou-taichou, but I do so thirst for that knowledge. How else can I get it?"</p>
					<p>A smile spread across his teacher's face.</p>
					<p>"If you are truly serious about this, then you have to promise me a few things."</p>
					<p>Akari thought for a moment, then followed his teacher out of the door.</p>
					<h1>the eager teacher</h1>
					<p>He and his teacher spent long hours after each day of school working more on his techniques.</p>
					<p>"You cannot simply rely on pure kidou, Akari-kun. The day will come when your blade will have to sing. At that time, kidou will be an aid, but cannot be your primary weapon. This will always save you where kidou might not," he said, pointing to Akari's heart. "That being said..."</p>
					<p>He drew his sword.</p>
					<p>"Come."</p>
					<p>Constantly pushing his limits due to school and his training with his newfound special teacher, he quickly reached levels of reiatsu and skills in all <a href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Shinigami" target="_blank">four areas of shinigami basics</a> that amazed even his teacher.</p>
					<p>"Yare Yare. You really can be a handful, Akari-kun."</p>
					<p>"You were when we started," Akari replied.</p>
					<p>"Hadou 4: Byakurai!", shouted Mahou-sensei.</p>
					<p>There was the slightest hesitation before Akari flashstepped out of the way. As he sighed a moment's relief, he was face-to-face with a sword pointed at his face.</p>
					<p>"Don't forget this, Akari. In a fight, we cannot afford ourselves the time to think. This sword is a real sword. Death happens here. Do not think that spirits cannot die; they can. You can. This is the risk you took joining this group of shinigami on the path to save and protect this world. Do you understand?"</p>
					<p>"Yes, Sensei," his eyes lowered, "I'm..."</p>
					<p>"Sorry? No. You're learning, Akari-kun," he said offering him a cup of water.</p>
					<p>"...and if I may say so, learning well. I'm proud of you."</p>
					<p>Akari smiled slightly. "I will work harder and make you proud, Sensei," he said, bowing before walking out of the door.</p>
					<p>"I am sure you will," Mahou-sensei said thoughtfully."</p>
					<h1>shiba kikyo</h1>
					<p>Akari meditated on the last few months of his training. They had been very intense and had come with many benefits. The greatest of these benefits was his relationship with Mahou. He smiled thinking about another day of training as he fell asleep each night.</p>
					<p>Soon, he received his zanpakutou from the Academy. Excited, he presented it to his Sensei as quickly as he could.</p>
					<p>"Seems that you're growing quite fast, young man."</p>
					<p>He was. In only a few months, he learned much. During his exercises, he usually ended up in groups that reported fewer casualties because of his excelling knowledge of shinigami basics. This, however, did not earn him many friends. People found him to be a show-off when he was merely attempting to be helpful. It further complicated matters when he tried to explain. Only one person dared to talk to him past the normal tasks...</p>
					<p>Her name was Shiba Kikyo. Sharing a similar thirst for knowledge, although not as intense as his, they shared similar viewpoints on battle strategies and the involvement of kidou in each. A friendship blossomed between them in only a short while and soon they were practically inseparable. Subsequently, suspicion arose.</p>
					<p>"So you like the girl, do you?"</p>
					<p>"Mahou-sensei!"</p>
					<p>"It's an innocent question."</p>
					<p>Akari blushed. For the first time in his life, he blushed. He had never considered the idea.</p>
					<p>"Well, she's nice..."" he avoided eye contact.</p>
					<p>"That she is, Akari. That she is. She may even make a good wife one day."</p>
					<p>Akari's current shade of red became a deep crimson and he was silent.</p>
					<p>"Enough of that for now. Why don't you have a cup of water?"</p>
					<p>In Akari's hands, the water in the cup quickly disappeared. He sighed loudly and cleared his head, then proceeded to practice the kidou he had reviewed so many times before. He was becoming proficient enough to use kidou without reciting the full incantations, however he did every now and then, just for the sake of doing so.</p>
					<p>Days spent with Kikyo were spent enjoying their common thirst for knowledge. A sort of competition developed between them to see who could best apply that knowledge.</p>

					<h1>strange magic</h1>
					<p>Days spent with Kikyo were spent enjoying their common thirst for knowledge. A sort of competition developed between them to see who could best apply that knowledge.</p>
					<p>"Ye lord! Mask of flesh and bone, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Truth and temperance, upon this sinless wall of dreams unleash but slightly the wrath of your claws. Hadou 33: Soukatsui!"</p>
					<p>Akari flashed stepped out of the way, shouting "Hainawa!" A rope of energy made its way toward Kikyo and she rolled to the right, deftly dodging most of the attack. Her left arm got caught. Akari came in for a downward strike.</p>
					<p>"Gotcha..."</p>
					<p>"Not today, Akari-kun," she thought as she made a quick circle on the floor where Akari stood. The ground beneath him turned into quicksand and he jumped back, his sword starting to sink into the newly formed quicksand.</p>
					<p>"What kidou is that? I haven’t seen that before..." He released Kikyo from the binding spell.</p>
					<p>"It's not quite kidou, but similar to it. It’s more like what they called 'magic' in the real world. It was passed down from one member of my family to another. This ability allows me to take the earth within my circle and change its form. Usually we only use this to turn things into powder or quicksand."</p>
					<p>"That's some ability! Can you teach me?!" Akari's eyes lit up.</p>
					<p>"I dunno..."</p>
					<p>"Pretty please..."</p>
					<p>"Okay okay okay..." Kikyo said, pretending to be nonchalant. "Place your hand on this rock and draw a circle."</p>
					<p>Akari nodded and did as he was told.</p>
					<p>"Next, remember that the earth within that circle is entirely yours. Will it to change into whatever form you want. Has to be earth, though."</p>
					<p>Akari closed his eyes and imagined quicksand flowing like lava out of a volcano. Surroundings faded away as he focused.</p>
					<p>"Wow! You're pretty good at this for the first time!"</p>
					<p>"What?" Akari's eyes opened and found that all of the earth ten feet ahead of him had turned into quicksand. He smiled.</p>
					<p>"Now let me teach you something," Akari said.</p>
					<p>"Like what?"</p>
					<p>"Fire a spell at me."</p>
					<p>"Are you kidding me?"</p>
					<p>"Not at all. Trust me."</p>
					<p>"Okay. Here goes. Ye lord! Mask of flesh and bone, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Truth and temperance, upon this sinless wall of dreams unleash but slightly the wrath of your claws. Hadou 33: Soukatsui!"</p>
					<p>Akari flashstepped, "Bakudou 61: Six-Rod Prison of Light."</p>
					<p>Kikyo felt the kidou hold her in place. "How did you do that without words?"</p>
					<p>He released her. "I'll show you. It's easy. Close your eyes. Try to remember how the energy from that spell felt as it gathered to you while you recited the incantation. Feel that energy coming to you now."</p>
					<p>Her reiatsu started to climb.</p>
					<p>"Now, when you feel that energy at its peak, call its name," Akari said, stepping backward.</p>
					<p>Eyes closed, Kikyo called out, "Hadou 33: Soukatsui!"</p>
					<p>Blue energy shot from her hand, obliterating the rock in front of her. She gasped, "Wow... I didn't know that you could even do something like this..."</p>
					<p>"That's how I felt when I did this the first time..."</p>
					<p>"How long have you been able to do this?!"</p>
					<p>"Let's just say a little while now."</p>
					<p>"I can't wait until I can do that again..."</p>
					<p>"Yeah, but um... you may not want to run out into the middle of everyone doing that. Could get you unwanted attention and then you'll end up like me."</p>
					<p>"What's wrong with being like you, Akari?" she said looking away. "I think you're wonderful..."</p>
					<p>Silence followed for moments, each one looking away from the other, not saying a word.</p>
					<p>"I think you're... wonderful, too. Kikyo."</p>
					<p>Without another word, the both of them walked back the student dorm areas, a little bit closer to each other. The sun set as they made their way home.</p>
					<p>As the training continued, they studied together after school hours. His training with Mahou slowed as exams were coming in order for him to focus on his training with basics and communing with his sword. In the down time, he practiced what he had learned carefully, hoping that he would be able to impress Mahou with his diligence.</p>
					<h1>shirabana</h1>
					<p>One night, under a full moon, Akari sat under a tree. Cherry blossoms from a nearby garden fell to the ground. As each petal fell, Akari lay next to his sword as he had for many days, hoping the sword would speak its secrets to him. Finally, on his fifth day lying under the full moon, he saw a feminine figure approach him through the falling petals. Behind her, there was a small pond that he was sure he missed earlier. The figure looked like Kikyo.</p>
					<p>"No, I am not who you think I am, Soujirou Akari," she said gently.</p>
					<p>She appeared to be younger in age, yet older than he was. Her beauty was deep. Her movements graceful. Startled, he reached for his sword...</p>
					<p>It was gone.</p>
					<p>"I am the spirit of that Zanpakutou you reached for. I am glad that you waited for me, Soujirou-san."</p>
					<p>He was wary, but not greatly so. "It was no trouble, really. I learned to love looking at the falling petals."</p>
					<p>She continued, smiling, "You have waited for me for many days, Soujirou-san, under the trees and the moon, as a lover waits for his beloved to appear and now I have come. What do you wish of me, Soujirou-san?"</p>
					<p>"I want to know you. I want to learn about you and become powerful enough to save the people I love. Not just that, though. I want to become one with you, too. I want to know what you think and how you feel and..."</p>
					<p>"I understand, Soujirou-san. I will give you the power you seek as much as you have sought after me."</p>
					<p>"What is your name? What shall I call you?"</p>
					<p>"My name is Masshirabana. Call that name and I will appear to you, willing to assist you. I will protect you so that you can protect your friends and be with me and I with you."</p>
					<p>Akari smiled slightly and bowed politely.</p>
					<p>Masshirabana got ready to walk away, but turned her head slightly.</p>
					<p>"By the way, is it okay if I call you 'Akari-chan'?"</p>
					<p>Akari was amazed. Smiling, he said, "Sure you can, Shira-chan."</p>
					<p>She seemed to blush slightly under the moonlight and faded into the night, leaving pure white flower petals in her wake. Startled, Akari awoke suddenly, finding himself under the same tree with the moon over his head. The night wind was stilled, making the area around him completely silent. Reaching for his sword, he found it in the same place that he left it before.</p>
					<p>Holding it before him, he whispered into the night, "<a href="javascript:alert('Sing into the night');">Yoru ni utae</a>, Masshirabana."</p>
					<p>From the hilt of his zanpakuto, five shapes formed, each resembling a lotus petal. Each petal and the blade was purest white. Petals fell around him and he smiled. The night wind picked up and whisked them all away. He let his reiatsu fill him, then overflow, feeling Masshirabana's presence with him.</p>
					<p>Sheathing his sword, he went back to his tree and lay down, falling asleep and whispering, "Oyasumi, Shira-chan..."</p>
					<p>The clouds played in the moonlight, causing shadows to pass over him occasionally as he slept.</p>
					<h1>master and student</h1>
					<p>"Today, I want to teach you something new, Akari."</p>
					<p>"Okay."</p>
					<p>"That's good, Akari-kun. Always be open to learning. Even after I can't teach you, this life and this energy you feel have much to say. Listen carefully and they will teach you wonderful and great things."</p>
					<p>"Yes, Mahou-sensei."</p>
					<p>"Now, Akari, I want you to fire a spell at me."</p>
					<p>Akari smiled.</p>
					<p>"I won't go easy on you, Sensei!"</p>
					<p>"I had hoped you would say that."</p>
					<p>"Ye lord! Mask of blood and flesh, all creation, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Inferno and pandemonium, the sea barrier surges, march on to the south! Bakudou 31: Shakkohou!"</p>
					<p>A fiery ball of red light shot from Akari's hands and shot off toward Mahou. At almost point blank range, there was an explosion. When the smoke cleared, Mahou stood there, smiling, unscathed.</p>
					<p>"Hanki. Do you know what this is, Akari-kun?"</p>
					<p>"I read about it. You output a wave of spiritual energy of enough quality and rotation to cancel the rotation of the spell coming toward you to cancel it, right?"</p>
					<p>"Good, Akari-kun! Very good. Today, I am going to teach you how to see that subtle movement and make counter movements on the spot."</p>
					<p>Akari brightened as he was presented with a book... and sighed loudly at the other 40 that followed. A smile found its way to his face and then he furrowed his eyebrows in preparation to study hard... and study he did. Each day after school was filled with extra hours of studying these books as his teacher watched, beaming.</p>
					<p>"Such hunger..." he would say as he felt the eddies of reiatsu from Akari as he studied diligently. Each day, he grew in knowledge and power. Eventually, Akari could even cast high level spells without needing the incantation at most of its potential power due to his intricate understanding of how energy worked.</p>
					<h1>you are my son</h1>
					<p>One day, he walked into the room to find Mahou missing.</p>
					<p>"I know you are here, Sensei. I sense the kidou in the room. This spell is... um..."</p>
					<p>"Bakudou 26: Curving Light," came the gentle reply, "but guess what I'm about to cast..."</p>
					<p>"Oh no..."</p>
					<p>"Hadou 4: Byakurai."</p>
					<p>"Enkosen!" Akari shouted, barely deflecting the attack.</p>
					<p>"Good, Akari-kun! Good!"</p>
					<p>Akari breathed heavily, "You're going to pay for that... Bakudou 26: Curving Light." He flashstepped just behind his teacher and drew a circle as quickly as he could, willing the earth to become quicksand.</p>
					<p>Mahou noticed just in time to jump away.</p>
					<p>"That was interesting. I haven't seen that technique in a long time, Akari-kun! Not in a long time indeed!"</p>
					<p>"What do you mean 'a long time'?"</p>
					<p>"Well, that technique is a type of earth magic that was used by the Shiba clan many years ago. I haven't heard anything from that noble house in ages, but it seems that they are alive and well and that one of them is at our academy."</p>
					<p>Akari was speechless. How could this guy know so much?</p>
					<p>"Maybe it is that Kikyo girl you mentioned..."</p>
					<p>Akari blushed a little bit. "Yeah, it is. She taught me that."</p>
					<p>"That's wonderful, Akari-kun! You two are practically married already..."</p>
					<p>A sandal went by his head, missing by a hair's breadth.</p>
					<p>"Quiet you."</p>
					<p>"Oh my... I do apologize, Akari-kun. By the way, it's almost graduation time. I haven't seen it yet, but I feel that you have gotten the one thing you lacked to graduate."</p>
					<p>"Yes, I know the name now."</p>
					<p>"Is that right? Congratulations, Akari! You're on your way to becoming a great shinigami! I sense it deeply. When is that graduation ceremony?!"</p>
					<p>Akari was shocked, "What?! You're a teacher at the academy and don't know when the graduation ceremonies are?! How could you..."</p>
					<p>"Kidding, Akari-kun! I am kidding! However, I want to be able to be at the exam, too. That's tomorrow. I am sure you will want to show everyone the wonderful things you learned, but try to hold back for now. You'll have plenty of time to expose those things when you're a full-fledged shinigami. Remember..."</p>
					<p>"...99 percent of all battle is illusion..." they said in unison.</p>
					<p>"Now then, do I get a peek?"</p>
					<p>"That shikai of yours?"</p>
					<p>Akari smiled slyly, "You'll just have to wait until tomorrow."</p>
					<p>"How cruel...!" Mahou said, being dramatic. Suddenly, he became serious.</p>
					<p>"Akari-kun, I know I can trust you as you have come to trust and rely on me. I have a few tasks for you as you graduate the academy. If you would not mind, I would like you to do these things."</p>
					<p>Akari was startled by the sudden seriousness of the request.</p>
					<p>"Sure, Mahou-sensei. Anything..."</p>
					<p>"First, join the second squad. Your kidou skills are exceptional, but I don't want you to join the Kidou Corps just yet. I want you to be better trained in Hakuda and Hohou and I think the second squad will be able to take you further in those things than I."</p>
					<p>Akari saddened for a moment.</p>
					<p>"Don't worry; it won’t keep us apart, it will only keep you busy. When you aren't on missions, stop by and see me and we can continue learning and growing together."</p>
					<p>"Okay, Mahou-sensei."</p>
					<p>"Also, I want you to know my full name, Soujirou Akari. It is Mahou Sougen. Remember it and never let it leave you just as you will never let my teachings leave you, Akari."</p>
					<p>"Yes sir!"</p>
					<p>"There's a feeling in the air, Akari-kun. There is a storm coming that I am not sure we are prepared for and I think these small attacks are only the beginning..."</p>
					<p>Akari was well aware of what he meant.</p>
					<p>Lately, ryoka had been spotted causing trouble in varying Rukongai districts. The disturbances started in the higher numbered districts, so it had been assumed that the disturbances were just normally occurrences for that area; it was filled with renegades and vagrants, unable to be peaceable and always having to fight for everything they wanted, not being able to work peacefully with those around them to accomplish goals.</p>
					<p>However, the disturbances continued in unrelated towns and started going up through districts. The first disturbance happened in district 95 and had been steadily progressing upward. These disturbances had been occurring for the last three weeks. The last time they were spotted was in District 72.</p>
					<p>Indeed, Akari had a keen sense of what Sougen was talking about. This wasn't something disorganized. Someone had a plan.</p>
					<p>"Hai, Sougen-sensei."</p>
					<p>"Did you just say, Sougen-sensei?"</p>
					<p>"I'm sorry if I was..."</p>
					<p>Akari felt arms around him. "No, Akari. Sougen-sensei is fine."</p>
					<p>Thoughts tumbled, one after another, in Akari's mind. His heart was chaos. "I know you're not my dad or anything, but I haven't felt like this in a while. My dad on earth was a good man, but I was more distant then, focusing too much on my studies. When I died, I remember watching him grieve and wishing I had let him love me as much as he wanted to and...," Akari tried to keep his composure, but tears fell in spite of his wishes.</p>
					<p>"Well, I am certainly not your father, but I care for you as if you were my son, Akari-kun."</p>
					<p>The room became full and silent. There was no further practice that day.</p>
					<h1>the disruption</h1>
					<p>Four months came and went. The disturbance had been brought further up in the Rukongai districts. The <a href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Ryoka" target="_blank">ryoka</a> had forged through to Rukongai district five; Akari's home. No one seemed to be able to stop whomever these ryoka were. Their power had to be unimaginable. Shinigami of up to third seat level had been defeated and captains were starting to get involved, scouting the areas and making preparations in Seireitei.</p>
					<p>Meanwhile, Akari had graduated and joined the second squad of the Gotei 13 as Sougen had requested. They trained him intensely and being duly diligent to the training he was given, his speed increased dramatically. He was able to move so quickly that he could create illusions of himself. The illusions lasted for only a moment, but combined with his sword skill, it gave him an incredible edge in battle. At the time he discovered this, he spent each free moment he could perfecting the techniques.</p>
					<p>He grew such that he was able to create two solid illusions of himself. These illusions could be maintained for only twenty seconds at first, but soon he was able to make the illusions last for ninety seconds. He figured that would be enough time for a tactical advantage and focused his attention on other aspects of his training. Black ops steps were incorporated making his movement faster than shunpou and consequently nearly impossible to notice. Only his captain and a few other captains could match that speed. His captain at the time was faster than he, so he strove for that speed.</p>
					<p>The attacks in the district had continued at a slightly slower rate. Now, Hollow were starting to appear in Rukongai. These were dispatched by the lower levels of shinigami without much effort at first, but now Menos began to appear. The cause had to be found. Rumors went around that people from squad two would soon be sent.</p>
					<p>The next day, his captain informed the squad that the rumors were true. Akari was to be sent on his first serious mission the following night. He went to Mahou to ask questions. Arriving at the front door, he found a note.</p>
					<p class="tegami">Akari-kun! I knew you would be here to ask me about the things you've heard and what you would be up against. I'm afraid to say, but there are things I must attend to at this moment. Let's just say I'm making preparations for certain events. I have left you a few things with some valuable insight. You are welcome to read them if you wish.</p>
					<p>"How does he always know?" Akari thought. He looked around and found a book nearby. It didn't seem like a normal textbook. Instead, he found a small book of notes on the spiritual composition of energy not before mentioned in Soul Society. Ceros interested him in particular. According to the notes, Hollows can use them from Gillian onward, but normal Hollows and shinigami cannot. This, among other things, filled his mind with more knowledge to enjoy and apply.</p>
					<p>When the following night came, he ran into Kikyo just before he left for his reconnaissance patrol.</p>
					<p>"So, how does it feel to head out there, Mr. Big Shot?"</p>
					<p>"Oh stop that. Makes me feel silly..."</p>
					<p>She suddenly became serious, "Be safe, Akari-kun."</p>
					<p>"I will, Kikyo-chan."</p>
					<p>He dashed off into the night with his team. The detachment he was in found little other than destruction, but gathered nothing helpful. They reported in via <a href="http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Jigokuch%C5%8D" target="_blank">hell butterfly</a>, but nothing happened at all. Sending their last butterfly, they prepared to go home.</p>
					<p>Getting home brought terrible news. The detachment sent to Rukongai district 25 had been wiped out except for one member and he was in the care of squad four. His wounds were such that he would easily be there for weeks. Other detachments that came to assist were in similar critical conditions. As to what happened, apparently, the shinigami in his detachment were fought by ryoka of anti-shinigami strength accompanied by two menos. Other detachments nearby went there to help, all being soundly defeated.</p>
					<p>The number of ryoka was hard to calculate due to their speed, making identification a moot point. Being attacked in the night made the task even more difficult. These people were apparently skilled tacticians. Whoever they were, one was female and seemed to be the leader. The other two were male and seemed to be her attendants. The darkness made their features indistinguishable. In addition to this, one of them seemed to have an ability that moved even faster than flash steps rivaling the ability of black ops steps.</p>
					<p>Akari spent the night wondering, "How did this happen? Who are these people? Why did they even make this disturbance in the first place?" The night plodded along and Akari couldn't sleep. Frustrated, he made his way to an open space near some abandoned buildings in Seireitei, and drew a circle on the ground.</p>
					<p>"Bakudou #58: Kakushitsuijaku." Looking for Kikyo's energy, he spotted it quickly and used another spell...</p>
					<p>Drawing the appropriate tattoos on himself, he recited another spell, "Bakudou #77: Tenteikuura."" The connection was easily made.</p>
					<p class="tegami">"Kikyo, I am awake. The ryoka have wounded many. I remain well and unharmed. I do not understand why these people would disturb Soul Society, but I am more committed than ever to defending it. These feelings keep me awake at night and since I have not been able to see Mahou-sensei yet, you are the only other person aside from Shira-chan I can talk to. You should rest as should I; we will need all of our strength in the days ahead. Oyasumi, Kikyo-chan."</p>
					<p>A thin veil of peace came to him, allowing him to sleep. He had never experienced this kind of fear before. He fell asleep whispering, "What are we going to do, Shira-chan?"" and felt a light touch caressing his face as he fell asleep.</p>
					<p>The next morning brought worse news than the night before; the ryoka had come into the first ten districts. Akari prepared himself and walking out of the door, he was met by Mahou.</p>
					<p>"Mahou-sensei."</p>
					<p>His face was stern. "No time, Akari-kun. Follow me."</p>
					<p>Akari followed him quickly, his heart pounding; Mahou had never been like this before.</p>
					<p>"Akari, as you know, we are in desperate times. Soon, the captains will be called on to handle this. Should they breach these walls and the shield we have placed around it, I have to make sure you know a few more things before things get serious. Depending on how things go, this may be one of the last times we get to be together like this and if I don't prepare you now, then this will definitely be the last time."</p>
					<p>"I understand."</p>
					<p>"Now, listen carefully. When we first met, I told you it was against Soul Society law to learn what we call forbidden techniques. I told you that it would get you exiled. Well, those techniques are known to me and they will soon be known to you along with other things. Make no mistake: Soul Society frowns upon those that use these techniques and that frown will remain, but in a time of need, they shall certainly bear you no malice. Do you accept this, Akari? The possibility that you will be alienated?"</p>
					<p>"I have been by everyone except Kikyo and you, Sougen-sensei. Maybe I always will."</p>
					<p>"That is enough. I have brought someone here for you to watch me use the spell on."</p>
					<p>"This should be interesting," Akari thought.</p>
					<p>"Step out, Kikyo."</p>
					<p>Akari's heart leapt. "Oh no."</p>
					<p>"Don't be afraid, Akari-kun. This will not harm her. Watch carefully, Akari-kun." Sougen's reiatsu was suddenly strong and forceful. Akari felt its weight and was amazed that he hadn't been crushed by it.</p>
					<p>"It's because of your training that you can stand at all, Akari-kun. To that end, I have trained you well. Attack me, Kikyo."</p>
					<p>Kikyo was gone in an instant and in the air, her sword attack coming down along with an incantation. Suddenly lightning shot from her finger. Moments before the spell hit Mahou, it froze complete in the air, along with Kikyo. She hung there, lightning suspended from her fingers.</p>
					<p>"...Jikanteishi..."</p>
					<p>Akari walked over in amazement. "Such power exists?"</p>
					<p>"That is why it is forbidden... or rather one reason. Keep watching."</p>
					<p>The room was a surge of reiatsu once more.</p>
					<p>"Kuukanten'i."</p>
					<p>Kikyo disappeared without a trace and reappeared an instant later several hundred meters removed from where they stood.</p>
					<p>"Mind you, you can move people much further away and even between dimensions like this world and the real one if you know how, but for the sake of example, this small movement will do."</p>
					<p>Moments later, Kikyo resumed her motion just as before, starting slowly and gradually gaining speed until she reached her full momentum. Rocks split under the force of her Byakurai. Landing, she flashstepped back to Mahou who blocked her attack barehanded.</p>
					<p>"This is how we were trained. I haven't always been the Kidou Corps captain. Before this station, I was one of many current captains that used to serve in the Detention Unit. We had to learn to fight barehanded against people with weapons..."</p>
					<p>Akari was taken aback.</p>
					<p>"That's right, Akari-kun. That's why I sent you there. I can tell you've improved drastically just from looking at you. Let me ask: how long can you hold those illusions now?"</p>
					<p>Surprise was etched into every feature of Akari's face; just how much did this man know about him?</p>
					<p>"Why do I know that? I didn't, but I could easily guess, Akari-kun. In all of our training, you never failed to keep up with me. You never noticed, but in each and every session we had, I made sure to increase the speed of my movement by a factor of five every time we practiced Zanjutsu and Hohou. You never failed to keep up even one time. You probably didn't even notice that the speed increased."</p>
					<p>Akari was speechless.</p>
					<p>"It's okay if you're amazed now; I was at the start. So back to my question..."</p>
					<p>"Two now..."</p>
					<p>"Good, Akari! That's absolutely fantastic! Mahou said, filling the room with a hearty laugh.</p>
					<h1>the first shot</h1>
					<p>The next few days were turbulent; if the near-constant attacks weren't enough, the confusion settling on each and every member of the Gotei 13 was unnerving. Several people of up to Vice-Captain level power were being defeated. Squad four was ever busy treating the wounded both day and night. People rose up from other squads to be trained in healing techniques in order to treat their wounded brethren. Many shinigami, from the fifth seat and down, became auxiliary healers, allowing those of squad four that were exhausted to rest.</p>
					<p>Akari, one of the few third seat that were unharmed, volunteered as well. His rigid training schedule and missions conflicted with this, so his skill was limited to treating light and mid-level wounds; the heavier types of wounds would have to be left to those more proficient. At night, he would continue to speak with Masshirabana to ease his mind. He and Kikyo weren't able to communicate as much; she had joined squad four and became even more proficient as a healer than a fighter. She would often say , "Akari-kun! Go beat up the dumb ryoka already so I can have a break!" and they would chuckle lightly and go about their day.</p>
					<p>The patrols became more and more dangerous. Akari's skills were more than enough to handle the Menos and other assortment of Hollow he came across.</p>
					<p>The ryoka, however, were another matter. Clashing swords with them, he felt an enormous surge of power. Their powers were like that of the hollow that fought alongside them, but they were not hollow themselves. A few things came to mind at that point and he decided that he would speak to Mahou about it when given the chance. For now, he had to get rid of the ryoka. His teammates were barely managing to keep up, but Akari's senses, now finely tuned, helped him see the truth; they were simply being toyed with. He had to end this quickly or...</p>
					<p>Slash. One team member was down. The other was taken down by a simple attack during an unguarded moment.</p>
					<p>"It seems I have no choice, Shira-chan... Yoru ni utae, Masshirabana!"</p>
					<p>Cherry blossom petals of purest white fell around the area of release, then faded into nothing. He wondered what the power of this sword would be; he had never had to call on it except to speak to Masshirabana's spirit. She never revealed anything to him in particular. Instead, she would simply say, "I will protect you, Akari-kun. I will keep anything away that harms you; none will touch you while you remain in my embrace." He wondered what that would mean.</p>
					<p>He deflected one attack after another and each attack was delivered at speeds matching even captains at their level. He was surprised by this. He knew they were powerful, but to be comparable to captains? He started to wonder if he was outclassed, when he heard Sougen's voice, "You are a strong warrior, my son." He fought even harder, gaining the upper hand against one of the ryoka when he became aware of a blade only inches away from him to the rear. A shiver of panic ran through him when he realized that yet another sword was coming toward him from the enemy he was currently engaged with. He went to block it, but noticed it suspended in mid-air; he was still able to freely move about, and made a wide slide to the now open chest in front of him. The attacker fell away, wounded but not yet dead.</p>
					<p>"Hadou #4: Byakurai."</p>
					<p>The opponent behind him was blasted instantly. Again, wounded but not killed; he had orders to return any ryoka alive to Soul Society he was able to subdue. A cloud passed over the moon, in the brief darkness that followed, the ryoka disappeared. He returned to Seireitei and made his report.</p>
					<p>"It was as if they had disappeared into the shadow of the cloud, Taichou."</p>
					<p>"I suppose it couldn't be helped. I am glad you are safe."</p>
					<p>"What of my teammates? How are they?"</p>
					<p>"It seems that these ryoka weren't interested in really killing them; they'll be fine in a weeks' time. In the meantime, I am interested to know: how did you manage to avoid being hurt?"</p>
					<p>"I don't know, Taichou. One of them tried to ambush me and I noticed them, but their sword seemed stuck in mid-air and unable to move..."</p>
					<p>"I see. That is an interesting zanpakutou and, if you don't mind my saying so, a very interesting relationship you both share."</p>
					<p>"Wha..."</p>
					<p>"I like knowing why my squad members constantly go to forests, secluding themselves in the late hours of the night, so I followed you one night."</p>
					<p>"I see. I am..."</p>
					<p>"No need. I think it is good for a shinigami to have that kind of relationship. Most captains don't have that level of intimacy with their zanpakutou at all."</p>
					<p>Squad eleven's captain came to mind. He was a rather uncouth man. Not without honor, but certainly a touch unruly. What he lacked in manners he made up with pure bloodlust and brute strength. Akari couldn't help the smile that crossed his face.</p>
					<p>"A rare and beautiful sight in dark days. You have an amazingly strong spirit, Akari-kun."</p>
					<p>"Thank you. Good night, Soifon Taichou."</p>
					<p>She curtly added, "That will be the only time you hear that and no one else will know that it was ever said. Am I clear?"</p>
					<p>"Perfectly."</p>
					<h1>familiar faces</h1>
					<p>"They what?"</p>
					<p>Akari went through every detail he could remember about the ryoka; their features, reiatsu, attack patterns, movement speeds... whatever he could call to mind.</p>
					<p>"Interesting. Thank you for that information, Akari-kun. That will help me greatly."</p>
					<p>Another shadow passed over the moon, after which there was a great explosion.</p>
					<p>"Seems that information may be used a bit sooner than I would like..."</p>
					<p>A roaring flame appeared and in the midst of it, the same three ryoka Akari had fought before. Each of them appeared unharmed; as if he hadn't touched them.</p>
					<p>"What kind of monsters are they? I slashed one of them wide op..."</p>
					<p>"That one,"" Mahou said, pointing at the female ryoka. "That one was from squad four although her rank eludes me. She's definitely a capable fighter, although her style is a bit unconventional. Those other two with her are definitely trouble."</p>
					<p>They walked into the night with Akari thinking, "So much for practice..."</p>
					<p>"I guess so." His gaze was intense. "Let's go, Akari."</p>
					<p>The three of them flew into the night. Things did not bode well. Kikyo sped off to her squad for instructions.</p>
					<p>"Akari, let your captain know what is going on and report to your squad."</p>
					<p>"Roger that."</p>
					<p>Reporting to his squad, he found them already on the move.</p>
					<p>"We already know, Akari. Don't rush into anything. Covert Ops is not just a name; don't be seen unless you must be, got it?"</p>
					<p>"Hai, Soifon-taichou!" the group said, dispersing.</p>
					<p>The explosion had come from the hospital.</p>
					<p>Akari's mind was ablaze trying to understand this attack; these were no amateurs. How would they have even known where to find that specific place out of all the other, much taller buildings in Seireitei? Questions were compounded with more unanswered questions and the time for answers was a long way off.</p>
					<p>Several previously wounded now lay dead and several of the members of squad four itself were now critically injured. This was not good at all.</p>
					<p>"Are you here to play, also?"</p>
					<p>A voice appeared behind him, then a slash came splitting him in two. Akari turned into several shreds of cloth before his assailant.</p>
					<p>"Yoru ni utae, Masshirabana. Arukiowaru."</p>
					<p>A sword was pointed at the assailant’s throat by another Akari that had appeared behind him.</p>
					<p>"Don't try to attack me. You cannot. In this space, no one can. Tell me why you are here and why you cause this destruction."</p>
					<p>The assailant attempted to move to reply unsuccessfully.</p>
					<p>"I see. Maybe you will be a little more cooperative when my captain arrives. Bakudou #7: Seki."</p>
					<p>The target paralyzed, Akari sheathed his sword and left the prisoner with two other squad members.</p>
					<p>"Don't trust him. Not at all. Don't bat your eyelashes for an instant or he'll get away. I'll be back as soon as I can with taichou."</p>
					<p>"Sure thing, Akari."</p>
					<p>He went to retrieve Soifon who was leaving the scene to regroup with several wounded team members. Explaining the situation, they went back to the spot Akari specified as quickly as shunpou would allow them.</p>
					<p>The two guys left with him were rendered unconscious and left with a piece of sekki stone nearby.</p>
					<p>"Dammit!"</p>
					<p>"No time! Let's go and catch him. You two, head west; you two, east, Akari, follow me."</p>
					<p>They were gone in a flash and soon ran into the three ryoka trying to head further into the city. They had to be crazy, but who knew; as powerful as they were, they could be a sufficiently difficult problem to handle for anyone. Barring their way, was a captain that was hard to make out. Lying near him were two vice-captains.</p>
					<p>Akari sighed, "This is troublesome..."</p>
					<h1>the vengeful captain</h1>
					<p>Getting closer, he saw the captain he spied in the distance and another figure next to him healing the vice-captains. It was Kikyo and Sougen.</p>
					<p>"That's quite enough from you," Sougen said with a smile.</p>
					<p>The female spoke, "However we are not yet finished."</p>
					<p>"We have a conflict of interest then," Sougen said, unsheathing his sword.</p>
					<p>Attacks happened at lightning speeds. As the swords flew, kidou was cast. Soifon had joined the fray with Akari only barely noticing her movement. Suzumebachi released, she sped quickly toward her target.</p>
					<p>Suddenly, she stopped moving.</p>
					<p>"You sure are loud for Special Ops, Soifon-san," one of the male ryoka said. "Seki. I'm sure you think I'll kill you. Well, to be honest, I will eventually. You will all pay for your crimes. For now, however, you will lie here, paralyzed and watching this battle. Note it well. Carve it into your mind. Know how powerless you are to stop us."</p>
					<p>Sougen was starting to become labored in his breathing from the constant attacks. Suddenly, he relaxed. Two swords came at him and suddenly the assailants went flying without them.</p>
					<p>"Let’s not run around poking with sharp things. It is too dangerous."</p>
					<p>"Don't take us lightly, old man."</p>
					<p>"Hoh? As you wish. Taiyou wo mamotte, gatsu wo taosu, Taiken."</p>
					<p>His sword changed colors. It was now solidly black on one side and white on the other. It had the shape of a Chinese sword.</p>
					<p>"I will tell you what this sword does, although you won't be able to stop it. It can perform a light attack and a dark attack."</p>
					<p>"I hope you don't expect to stop us with parlor tricks."</p>
					<p>"Most certainly not," Sougen said smiling. "I intend to defeat you. Now, shall we begin?"</p>
					<p>One of the assailants became a blur and attacked Sougen from behind.</p>
					<p>"Dakishime."</p>
					<p>The other figure disappeared.</p>
					<p>"He can be returned, but know that you cannot have him unless you leave this place immediately; I do not truly wish to fight with you. On the other hand, the damage you have done here cannot go unnoticed or unpunished..." he sat on the ground to think. "What to do... What to do...?"</p>
					<p>The second male ryoka stepped forward, "Soukatsui."</p>
					<p>Sougen placed a hand up and the attack dispersed. "Not while I’m thinking please."</p>
					<p>"This place will surely be your grave," he said rushing toward Sougen.</p>
					<p>Sougen pointed the white end of the sword at his assailant, "Hatsu!" The person he absorbed earlier was propelled violently out of whatever space he was in toward the oncoming ryoka, who was sidestepped. Sougen appeared behind the oncoming assailant. "Do you understand?"</p>
					<p>"I'm not sure you do, old man," the second ryoka said fading away from view.</p>
					<p>Slash.</p>
					<p>The first ryoka had slashed at Sougen, giving him a light wound. Suddenly a hole appeared below him and he fell.</p>
					<p>"You weren't paying attention, Mahou-san," the female ryoka said.</p>
					<p>The hole started to fill with sand as other squad members approached. There weren't many. The hole closed.</p>
					<p>"I think it was you that didn't pay attention," Sougen said falling toward them.</p>
					<p>"It doesn't matter. We have what we want for now," the first ryoka said. Several explosions occurred suddenly, leveling half of Seireitei. Following the explosions, half of the city sunk into the ground. Sinkholes had suddenly appeared below large sections of the city. They started to run away, but found themselves frozen in place.</p>
					<p>"Jikanteishi... Geez. What a way to make a mess of things. Why can't you young people be more cooperative?"</p>
					<p>One of them spoke, "I think you would be more aware of why than anyone. We will have justice, Sougen."</p>
					<p>"We cannot allow that, Usagi-chan."</p>
					<p>"You will call me Hitsuyami if you speak to me again, Sougen."</p>
					<p>"You know how I am with formalities. My apologies."</p>
					<h1>the burning city</h1>
					<p>The other ryoka were rounded up and taken into custody by the bystanding shinigami.</p>
					<p>Only the female was left.</p>
					<p>"I only have a few moments before that kidou dispels," Sougen thought. "This must end quickly."</p>
					<p>"I know what you're thinking, Mahou-san. However, they will get away. I will get away. Everything will be destroyed and you will be unable to stop it." Hitsuyami said with a smile. A hole appeared below her and she sank into it within an instant. A subsequent boom was heard in the distance. The ryoka were again gone and soon people were flying about trying to find them. Wounded littered the jailing area and there was a hole in the floor; the only spot without Sekki stone.</p>
					<p>Mahou and Akari ran into the middle of the pack and tried to sprint to the front. They made it in just enough time to see the ryoka standing just outside of the gate of Seireitei. Everyone had paused for a moment as one of them spoke.</p>
					<p>"As you know, you have no way of fighting us or keeping up with even the least of our powers. I applaud you &ndash; your efforts were quite entertaining, but I believe that the game is over and it is time to close the curtain..."</p>
					<p>One of the shinigami charged toward him, a fifth-seat from squad 13.</p>
					<p>"Cero..."</p>
					<p>A beam of fiery red light sped toward the target, obliterating him and a few others near him.</p>
					<p>"Let's not interrupt, please."</p>
					<p>Sougen showed up and Akari followed quickly behind. Akari sensed something amiss in the situation.</p>
					<p>"Mahou-sensei..."</p>
					<p>"Akari, I apologize..." Mahou shot off into the distance and Akari attempted to follow. He found himself unable to move, the movement of everyone became slow, then stilled.</p>
					<p>"Don't go, Mahou-sensei... Sougen..."</p>
					<p>"Jikanteishi. You must understand, Akari. This spell will not last long and I fear for the worst. I may not live, but I will assure that you will and that, if anything does happen to me that you at least will live. Don’t fear for Kikyo. She is a capable warrior just as you are..." A tear began to fall, "...but she is not my daughter. You, however, are most assuredly my son. Goodbye, Akari..."</p>
					<p>"Sougen..."</p>
					<p>"Kuukanten'i..."</p>
					<p>The world around him began to fade away, then became nothing. He awoke in a world without a zanpakutou and in the middle of a field with benches. This was the real world; he was in a park.</p>
					<p>His mind cleared and memories flooded back to him. Shortly before he disappeared, the shinigami had gathered and tried to charge the ryoka standing before the gate. Mahou sensed the energy and tried to save the one person he had the energy to save. There was a net of kidou woven around the city. The energy had an unusual density to it; the two males had blended their combined energy into this net. Considering their speed, only a span of an hour would have been needed to weave the net. So many troops inoperable, the thought of a defensive spell was preposterous at best. "I guess this was a good adventure." He stepped into the center of the circle and formed a shield. The kidou so spread out, the shield was unable to bear up under the intensity of the attack and with the remaining force being unable to fight at full capacity, the shield gave way. As the flames reached Akari, he disappeared.</p>
